# Game Table Version 0
## 15/06/2020
This project is designed to help the user choose a game from the selection of different games based on their time till completion

## Requirements
- The product should help people choose a game, which removes the time needed to make a decision.
- The product should be accessible to people who play games, so that anyone can have their time saved.
- Being able to add and remove games that are currently being played should be possible, allowing the program to know what games the user wants to play.
- It should track how long a person plays a game, which the program will use to help prioritise certain games.
- Know the schedule of free time and work of the player, so the game knows how long to set a specific session.

## Specifications
- The product should know how long a game takes to finish, or if it keeps playing infinitely. This allows the program to know when the player would finish the game.
- Having an easy to access app or program so that people can use the product easily, this reduces time wasted using the program.
- Whether friends are playing a game, and how long they have played for. Certain games are only enjoyable when played with friends, so knowing how many friends are online could be helpful
- A simple way to add data of games to be played, how long to beat, if it is multiplayer, priority. This breaks down the information into values so that they can be processed through the algorithm
- A way to reduce priority of a game. As some people may start to lose interest in a game, there needs to be a way to reflect that in the algorithm
- Adding how long a person should be playing a game for, updating with how long the person did play for. This can be used in tandem with the length of the game to help the decision.
- Adding a general schedule of free time to work time, so times can be allocated. This will help know the schedule and length of free time that is to be used for.

## Getting Started

This program will require installing Python 3.8
